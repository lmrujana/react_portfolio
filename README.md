# React Portfolio

## Description

Personal Portfolio made with React.js and Sanity Studio. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my abilities as a Full-Stack Web Developer, by showing different projects that I have worked on, while being a single-page web app itself. Building the portfolio was done following the instructions of Kapehe, on Traversy Media YouTube Chanel.
